        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>
            I was born in Toronto, Canada. At the young age of 10 months, my family moved back to Poland, where I spent the next 7
            years of my life growing up in a small village 2 hours away from Krakow.
            At the age of 8, my family moved back to Canada, to the Greater Toronto Area, where I spent two years (grades 2 and 3)
            in the ESL (English as a Second Language) program.
            At the age of 10, my family moved to the city of Mississauga, and attended St. Gerard. This school was not very good. In
            fact, we only had 1 field trip planned all year, to Medeival Times, but the Principal took the money allocated for the
            trip, and bought himself a new sports car. He didn't remain our Prinipcal for very long.
            To improve my circumstances, I applied to a French Immersion program, and was accepted. I spent the next 4 years in the
            French Immersion program, and learned to speak French fluently. The humanity courses were in French, and the science
            courses were in English.

            For High School, I attended Philip Pocock Secondary School, in the French Extended Program, which also included all the
            humanities in French, and sciences in English.
            The school only offerred one advanced placement course, math, in which I scored the highest grade. Without studying, in
            my senior year, I placed in the 1% percentile in the Waterloo Math Contest.
            I was a member of the school's soccer, cross country, swimming, and track and field teams. I set 4 Track and Field
            school records, across multiple events.
            I completed in the OFSAA champonships for both Track and Field and Cross Country. Additionally, I qualified for the
            Canadian Youth and Junior Championships for Track and Field for 800m and 2000 meter steeplechase.
            In parallel, I was a certified lifeguard, which included CPR, AED, and First Aid certifications.
            Finally, I was a Link Crew Leader, which meant that I served as a mentor to incoming freshmen, and helped them navigate
            the school.

            For University, I attended the University of Waterloo, where I studied Mechanical Engineering, and graduated in 2019.
            My scholarships include the President's Scholarship (for academic excellence), and the James Dyson Scholarship (for
            innovation and entrepreneurship).
            I received a minor in Mechatronics Engineering, which included overloading my schedule for 2 semesters (taking 4
            additional courses), and taking all Mechatronics courses in the final year.
            I was a member of the University of Waterloo's Baja SAE team for a year, before realizing that I was more interested in
            the software side of things.
            I learned software engineering on my own as a side hobby, which spun up many of my personal projects at the time (see my
            personal projects portfolio abreast).
            At the Univesity, I also enrolled in the Velocity Entrepreneurship Residence Program for 4 months, where I worked on my
            first startup - a ridesharing app - which was a failure due to the intense competition and my lack of experience.
            However, it was an amazing experience for understanding the startup ecosystem, and the challenges of building a product
            from scratch.

            My voluntary research included the bioengineering and biotechnology lab, where I developed a motion sensing system using
            LEAP Motion to test neurological cognitive responses in people with concussions.
            I also worked with EEG data to create a de-noising algorithm for the researchers.

            The University of Waterloo allowed me to work at 6 different companies for 4 months each. This included living for 8
            months in California, and 4 months in Boston.
            While living in Boston, I decided to do some research with MIT's Media Lab. Here, I worked on relibily producing DLP 3D
            printed hair structures (100um thick) on a mesh fabric.
            This included designing a large Arduino-controlled gantry system to accelerate the printing process and development of
            the parts.
            While working California at Google X, I also worked at the Google's Product Innovation Lab on Friday evenings. This
            opened my eyes to the world of product design and user experience.

            After graduating, I moved to San Jose, California, where I worked at Apple as a Robotics Engineer, quickly becoming the
            Engineering Lead for the team.
            I was responsible for the development of the hardware and software for the Sensors SQA team, which included building
            robotic and computer vision systems to test
            various components, systems, features, and products. The focus was mostly on the biometric sensors such as FaceID and
            TouchID.
            As amazing as Apple was, I wanted a bigger challenge, so I enrolled in Georgia Tech's Master of Computer Science OMSCS
            program, specializing in Robotics and Computational Perception. This was done in parallel with my full-time job at
            Apple.

            After 2 years, I decided to work at a smaller company, so I joined Cobalt Robotics (now Cobalt AI), where I quickly got
            promoted to a Staff Robotics Engineer.
            Here, I was responsible for building the entire robotics software stack (Localization, Mapping, and Motion Planning), as
            well as the product development of the V2 of the Autonomous Mobile Security Robot.
            As with any startup, my responsibilites were not limited to just algorithms in robotics. I had to build networking
            pipelines, manage teammates, come up with the robotics roadmap, and so on...
            About 1 year into the company, I finally finished my OMSCS Master's Program.

            After 3 years at Cobalt, I fully commited to building Olden Labs, a company that I co-founded with some extremely
            talented and hard-working people.
            At Olden Labs, we are enabling better animal research through comprehensive data. This is done using a vision-based
            system that tracks the animals' behavior and movement.
            Here, I am responsible for the techonology stack, which includes the software (machine learning, computer vision, video
            streaming pipelines), hardware (custom IoT), and the cloud infrastructure (AWS and networking).
            Of course, as for most co-founders, maintaining strong relationships with the customers, partners, and shareholders is a
            key part of the job.

            In summary, I'm a technologist and builder with a passion for creating intelligent systems and algorithms. I'm
            ridiculously fast learner and possess an ardor for problem solving.
